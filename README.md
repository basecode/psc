# PSC â€“ Particle System Configurator

A first attempt to port my already existing [Canvas2D Version](http://demojs.org/2011/releases/Freestyle/online/basecode_-_Particles.js/) to WebGL.

**Why the hell am I using a WebGL Renderer, even so this Library is just about 2D geometry operations / real time drawing?**

Well, I expected a huge performance-boost and it turns out the new renderer increased the amount of particles by a factor of 15 - 24. That means instead of 500 (Canvas2D, 40FPS), I am now able to draw 7500-12000 particles with a frame rate of 60FPS.  

**But why am I using Three.js and not the pure WebGL API?**

Good question. It seemed to be easier. At the end I guess it was the right decision.

**What's next?**

Dropping Three.js and writing a pure WebGL port.


### Show me your Configuration!

When you think your configuration is cool then just save it by creating a permalink and send it to me or to your friends.

This is how a permalink looks like:
